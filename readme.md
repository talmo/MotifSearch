===========

A simple set of classes and functions to search for search for motifs in a
genome based on positional scoring, i.e. PSSM.

### Features:
- Position Specific Frequency Matrix (PSFM)
- Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) scoring
- Entropy statistics (information)
- Information scoring
- Sliding window search
- FASTA file parsing

### Soon* to feature:
- Extended Suffix Array sequence searching
- Boltzmann probability for transcription factor binding
- GenBank parsing (likely using BioPython)
